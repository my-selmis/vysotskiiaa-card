  "about_text_1": "I have been learning game design and analysing games since 2021. I apply a systematic approach in game development and focus on systemic design. I favour creating simple mechanics from which emerge engaging dynamics similar to monsters in \"Lethal Company\" or abilities in the latest \"Zelda\" titles.",
  "about_text_2": "I'm into psychology as I love exploring player behaviour or effective learning techniques. To add to that, I follow industry research, such as Quantic Foundry's \"Player Motivations\".",
  "about_text_3": "Also, I have worked on games in unconventional genres, namely \"puzzle-runner\" and \"action-typer\".",
